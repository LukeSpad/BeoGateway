Basic monitoring and reporting of traffic on the Bang and Olufsen MasterLink network, including basic MasterLink packet
information, the MLGW protocol, and the Home Automation Protocol

The code requires a MasterLink or BeoLink Gateway to run - it is untested with the BeoLiving Intelligence

The code draws heavily on the existing MLGW project by user Giachello: https://github.com/giachello/mlgw,
but is recoded for Python 2.7

The repository includes:

main.py         Test programme to monitor events on the Bang and Olufsen Network
