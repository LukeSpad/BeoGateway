Basic monitoring and reporting of traffic on the Bang and Olufsen MasterLink network, including basic MasterLink packet
information, the MLGW protocol, and the Home Automation Protocol

The code requires a MasterLink or BeoLink Gateway to run - it is untested with the BeoLiving Intelligence

but is recoded for Python 2.7
